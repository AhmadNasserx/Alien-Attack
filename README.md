Alien Attack - Space Shooter Side-Scroller
Alien Attack is a fast-paced side-scrolling space shooter, developed in Godot 4 using GDScript. Players navigate a spaceship through waves of alien enemies while aiming to achieve high scores. This project was an excellent opportunity to explore essential game development concepts, including:  
- Utilizing **Path2D** and **PathFollow2D** nodes for smooth enemy movement patterns.  
- Designing an efficient **Enemy Spawner** to dynamically generate challenges.  
- Implementing a custom **HUD** to display health, score, and other vital stats.  
- Creating a persistent **High Score System** to track player performance across sessions.  

Alien Attack showcases core mechanics for arcade-style games, blending gameplay with polished UI and functional systems.
